    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Data Privacy Vocabulary provides terms (classes and properties) to annotate and categorize instances of legally compliant personal data handling. In particular, t he vocabulary provides extensible taxonomies of terms to describe these components, namely:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Data Categories</li>
      <li>Purposes</li>
      <li>Processing Categories</li>
      <li>Technical and Organisational Measures</li>
      <li>Legal Basis</li>
      <li>Consent</li>
      <li>Recipients, Data Controllers, Data Subjects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These terms are intended to annotate Legal Personal Data Handling in a machine-readable fashion, by specifying which personal data categories are undergoing a specific kind of processing, by a specific data controller and/or shared with some recipient for a particular purpose , based on a specific legal ground (e.g. consent or legitimate interest), with specific technical and organisational measures and restrictions (e.g. storage location and storage duration) in place.</p>
    <p>Descriptions and respective annotations of Legal Personal Data Handling could be used for example to:</p>
    <ol start="1">
      <li>declare personal data handling policies ,</li>
      <li>declare consent for a personal data handling policy (by a specific consent action),</li>
      <li>transparently log/document specific personal data handling actions by a data controller, and finally</li>
      <li>to support automated checking of legal compliances of data handling ex ante (before data handling is actually performed), or ex post (i.e. check compliance to a certain policy and/or consent )</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Base Vocabulary</h2>
    <p>The ‘Base Vocabulary’ describes the top-level classes defining a policy for legal personal data handling. Classes and properties for each top-level class are further elaborated using sub-vocabularies, e.g. the Personal Data taxonomy. While all concepts within the vocabulary share a single namespace, the modular approach makes it possible to use the sub-vocabularies without the <code><a href="#dpv:PersonalDataHandling">:PersonalDataHandling</a></code> class, for example to refer only to purposes. Exceptions to this are the NACE purpose taxonomy extending the <code><a href="#dpv:Sector">:Sector</a></code> concept in Purposes vocabulary, and the GDPR legal bases taxonomy extending the top-level <code><a href="#dpv:LegalBasis">:LegalBasis</a></code> class, which are provided under a separate namespace to indicate their specialisation.</p>
    <figure>
      <img title="DPV Base Vocabulary" alt="DPV base vocabulary" src="./diagrams/personaldatahandling.png">
      <figcaption>Base Vocabulary</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>An instance of PersonalDataHandling is associated with one or more instances of Personal Data Category, Purpose, Processing, Recipient, Technical and Organisation Measures, Legal Basis, and Data Controller. The vocabulary provides relevant properties for associating each top-level concept with the PersonalDataHandling class, such as hasPurpose and hasDataSubject to associate with Purpose and Data Subject respectively.</p>
    <p>Currently, the DPVCG vocabulary does not provide any constraints on the inclusion or exclusion of concepts used to define an instance of PersonalDataHandling. Possibilities for this include use of OWL2 semantics and SHACL to define concepts mandatory in an instance of PersonalDataHandling. For example, one could define that every instance of PersonalDataHandling *MUST* have at least one Personal Data Category, Controller, Purpose, and Legal Basis.</p>

  <section id="vocab-personal-data-categories">
    <h2>Personal Data Categories</h2>
    <p>DPVCG provides broad top-level personal data categories adapted from the taxonomy provided by EnterPrivacy. The top-level concepts in this taxonomy refer to the nature of information (financial, social, tracking) and to its inherent source (internal, external). Each top-level concept is represented in the DPVCG vocabulary as a Class, and is further elaborated by subclasses for referring to specific categories of information - such as preferences or demographics.</p>
    <p>Regulations such as the GDPR allow information about personal data used in processing to be provided either as specific instances of persona data (e.g. “John Doe”) or as categories (e.g. name). Additionally, the class SpecialCategoryOfPersonalData represents categories that are ‘special’ or ‘sensitive’ and require additional conditions as per GDPR’s Article 9.</p>
    <p>The categories defined in the personal data taxonomy can be used directly or further extended to refer to the scope of personal data used in processing. The taxonomy can be extended by subclassing the respective classes to depict specialised concepts, such as “likes regarding movies” or combined with classes to indicate specific contexts. The class DerivedPersonalData one such context where information has been derived from existing information, e.g. inference of opinions from social media. Additional classes can be defined to specify contexts such as use of machine learning, accuracy, and source.</p>
    <p>While the taxonomy is by no means exhaustive, the aim is to provide a sufficient coverage of abstract categories of personal data which can be extended using the subclass mechanism to represent concepts used in the real-world.</p>
    <p class="note">ISSUE: the property hasPersonalDataCategory has the range PersonalDataCategory, therefore, object of any triple using this property would be inferred as an instance of PersonalDataCategory. Now, how to refer to a personal data category (class) using this property, as it would infer that class to be an instance as well as a subClass of PersonalDataCategory - is this intended and okay as we suggest the following use of personal data taxonomy:
    <pre>dpv:hasPersonalDataCategory dpv:EmailAddress .</pre>
    <p>Other alternative is to scope it within a blank node as:</p>
    <pre>dpv:hasPersonalDataCategory [ a dpv:EmailAddress] .</pre>
    <p>But this would conflate it with instances of email address e.g. <code>< me@example.com > a dpv:EmailAddress</code>.</p>

    #import PersonalDataCategory
  </section>
  <section id="vocab-purposes">
    <h2>Purposes</h2>
    <p>DPVCG at the moment defines a hierarchically organized set of generic categories of data handling purposes. Regulations such as GDPR generally require a specific purpose to be declared in an understandable manner. We therefore suggest to declare the specific context as an instance of one or several dpv:Purpose categories and to always declare the specific purpose with a human readable description (e.g. by using <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>rdfs:comment</code>). E.g.</p>
    <pre>:NewPurpose rdfs:subClassOf dpv:DeliveryOfGoods, dpv:FraudPreventionAndDetection ;
    rdfs:label “New Purpose” ;
    rdfs:comment “Does some processing for delivery of goods and fraud prevention” .
    dpv:Purpose rdfs:subClassOf [ onProperty rdfs:comment owl: someValuesFrom … ]</pre>
    <p>Purposes can be further restricted to specific contexts using the class <code><a href="dpv:Context">dpv:Context</a></code> and the property <code><a href="dpv:hasContext">dpv:hasContext</a></code>. DPVCG provides a way to restrict purposes to a specific business sector using the class <code><a href="dpv:Sector">dpv:Sector</a></code> and the property <code><a href="dpv:hasSector">dpv:hasSector</a></code>. Hierarchies for defining business sectors include NACE (EU) ( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=NACE_REV2 ), NAICS (US) ( https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/ ), ISIC (UN) ( https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications ), and GICS ( https://www.msci.com/gics ). Multiple classifications can be used through mappings between sector codes such as NACE - NAICS ( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=NACE_REV2 ). At the moment, we recommend to specify this sector in terms of the EU NACE codes, where the codes can be specified using the URI scheme <code>dpv-nace: NACE-CODE</code>.</p>
    <p>For example, a purpose can be restricted to the domain of scientific research using its corresponding NACE code M72, which can be represented as:</p>
    <pre>:SomePurpose a dpv:Purpose ;
    rdfs:label “Some Purpose” ;
    dpv:hasSector dpv-nace:M72 .</pre>
    <p>We suggest selecting the most appropriate or applicable purpose over more abstract ones by selecting or extending the relevant classes in the purpose taxonomy. For example, the purpose Optimisation can be further clarified to be optimisation for the consumer, or the controller.</p>

  <section id="vocab-processing-categories">
    <h2>Processing Categories</h2>
    <p>DPVCG provides a hierarchy of classes to specify the operations associated with the processing of personal data. Declaring the processing or processing categories associated with personal data is required by regulations such as the GDPR. Common processing operations such as collect, share, and use have certain constraints or obligations in GDPR, which makes it necessary to accurately represent them for personal data handling. While the term ‘use’ is liberally used to refer to a broad range of processing categories in privacy notices, we suggest to select and use appropriate terms to accurately reflect the nature of processing where applicable.</p>
    <p>We define top-level classes to represent the following broad categories of processing - Disclose, Copy, Obtain, Remove, Store, Transfer, and Transform. Each of these are then further expanded using subclasses in the taxonomy, which includes terms defined in the definition of processing in GDPR (Article 4-2).</p>
    <p>The DPVCG taxonomy provides properties with a boolean range to indicate the nature of processing regarding Systematic Monitoring, Evaluation or Scoring, Automated Decision Making, Matching or Combining, Large Scale processing, and Innovative use of new solutions - which are relevant towards interpretation of legal requirements such as GDPR compliance.</p>

    #import Processing
  </section>
  <section id="vocab-technical-organisational-measures">
    <h2>Technical and Organisational Measures</h2>
    <p>Regulations require certain technical and organisational measures to be in place depending on the context of processing involving personal data. For example, GDPR (Article 32) states implementing appropriate measures by taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks, rights and freedoms. Examples of measures stated in the article states include:

        <li>the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services</li>
        <li>the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident</li>

      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>To address these requirements, the DPVCG defines a hierarchical vocabulary for declaring technical and organisational measures. For any of the declared measures defined below, we provide a generic ObjectProperty (dpv:measureImplementedBy), and for the values of this attribute, we either allow a blank node with a single rdfs:comment to describe the measure, or a URI to a standard or best practice followed, i.e. a well-known identifier for that standard or a URL where the respective document describes the standard. The class StorageRestriction represents the measures used for storage of data with two specific properties provided for storage location and duration restrictions.</p>
    <p>In the future, we plan to provide a collection of URIs for identifying recommended standards and best practices. Future versions of this document may extend the vocabulary by an approved taxonomy of identifiers for such standards and best practices.</p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>Consent is one of the legal bases for the processing of personal data which has several requirements and obligations that determine its validity and use as a legal basis. DPVCG provides the necessary terms and relationships to describe consent and its attributes from a compliance perspective. While the focus of the taxonomy is on the use of consent as a legal basis within the GDPR, the vocabulary can be adapted or extended to define other forms of consent.</p>
    <p>The DPVCG consent vocabulary uses the set of properties from the base vocabulary to associate instances of dpv:Consent with Personal Data Categories, Purposes, Processing, Data Controllers, Recipients, Technical and Organisational Measures, and Data Subject. Additionally, the vocabulary also specifies properties for provision (how consent was given) and withdrawal (how consent was withdrawn) to define the provenance of consent. The expiry of consent can be specified using the property dpv:expiry, with sub-properties provided to define expiry as a temporal entity using dpv:expiryTime or as a condition/event using dpv:expiryCondition.</p>
    <p>Certain requirements for valid consent require some information to be presented before the consent is obtained in order for it to be considered an ‘informed consent’. This information and the notice it was provided in can be specified using the property dpv:consentNotice. Additionally, the property dpv:isExplicit can be used to specify if the consent is to be interpreted as ‘explicit consent’ using a boolean value (true/false).</p>
    <p>To specify consent provided by delegation, such as in the case of a parent or guardian providing consent for a child, the properties dpv:provisionByJustification and dpv:withdrawalByJustification can be used to capture the nature of such ‘delegation’, with the fields dpv:provisionBy and dpv:withdrawalBy capturing the legal entity who provided the consent. By default, the consent is assumed to have been provided by the associated Data Subject.</p>
